# Cold Call Assist 

This is a python program designed to assist in the fair and randomized selection of students for cold calling in a classroom. 
A graphical manager will display four students and associated data on screen. Key stroke interactions will cycle between or remove students from being on deck. Students can be flagged for review later. A daily and term roster can be generated. Many user settings are configurable.
